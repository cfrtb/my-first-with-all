Text Domain: wpforge

This theme, like WordPress, is licensed under the GPL. I hope you utilize WP-Forge to learn something new, create something awesome, have fun and, more importantly, I hope you share what you have learned with others.

Use style.css to modify anything related to WordPress - To modify anything regarding Foundation, you need to modify foundation.css: /css/foundation.css

I highly recommend using my child theme WP-Starter with WP-Forge, as I update WP-Forge on a regualr basis and if you update WP-Forge, you may lose any edits.
